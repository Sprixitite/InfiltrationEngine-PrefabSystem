# Demystifying Prefabs // Part 0: Documentation Usage
## Previous Entry: N/A
##     Next Entry: [0.5: Intro](./0_5_Background.md), [1.0: Basics](./1_0_Basics.md)

# Subject
Welcome to this (hopefully quite short) series on InfiltrationEngine PrefabSystem - this entry is a prelude to explain who this documentation aims to be useful for, as well as how to navigate the docs, with all the half-entries and whatnot.

# Content

## Half-Entries?
> <sub><i>"I mean... seriously!? This isn't a program... it's some documentation... what the hell!"</i></sub>

This doc series contains several "Half-Entries", with a non-integer placement in reading-order.  
These "Half-Entries" are to be considered **optional** chapters, these are mostly composed of auxilliary information, not pertaining to the direct usage of Prefabs.

> [!TIP]
> Read the "**Subject**" heading of each optional chapter before deciding whether to skip over them or not.

## Expectations For The Reader
When it comes to what these docs expect of the reader, you're expected to understand the concepts listed here:
- Roblox Instances
- Instance Attributes
- Instance Properties
- The difference between attributes and properties
- The rough layout and innerworkings of custom missions

Should you not have at least a semi-firm grasp on all the above, these docs will likely be of little use to you outside of [The Basics](./1_0_Basics.md), as these docs do not aim to operate as a Roblox Studio or InfiltrationEngine tutorial.

Later entries on advanced features may be quite dense and may depend on at least a passing familiarity with Lua or general programming jargon, this entire thing won't be a picture-book. Should you find a chapter difficult to use, consider taking a break.

## Navigation
Every documentation entry should be structured as follows:
1) Title
2) Previous/Next entry
3) Subject
4) Main Content
5) Sign-Off
6) Examples
7) Footnotes

Some entries may omit certain sections if they aren't applicable, like this entry which omits the "Examples" heading - unfortunately I don't have any examples of people getting rich quick off of these docs quite yet.

> [!NOTE]
> Examples are placed *after* the sign-off but will be linked to from the main content where appropriate.

## On Footnotes & References
Some entries may feature text annotated with a reference[^1], these link to extra information located beneath the [Footnotes](#footnotes) segment of the entry.  
References should be treated as "extra-credit", containing unnecessary information provided for completeness or amusement. Should you be easily overwhelmed by large amounts of text, consider ignoring the references.
[^1]: Like this! This is a reference!

# Sign-Off
Now that this little bit of preamble about what to expect is out of the road, you should move on to reading one of the following:
### [0.5: Intro](./0_5_Background.md) 
Some interesting background about the goals of the plugin & how it came to be, for those just as much of a dweeb as myself.

### [1.0: The Basics](./1_0_Basics.md) 
The first full, real, useful, worthwhile, not-a-waste-of-your-time entry in the series.
